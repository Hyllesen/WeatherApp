### Getting started

1. Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and create a free API key.
Activation of an API key for Free and Startup accounts takes 10 minutes.

2. Ensure you can run a basic React Native tutorial via [Facebook Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

3. Run in terminal
 ```git clone https://github.com/Hyllesen/WeatherApp.git && cd WeatherApp && npm install```
4. Replace APIKEY in APIKEY.js with your own API key from OpenWeatherMap.org
5. Run in terminal ```npm run ios```to run in iOS emulator or ```npm run android```to run in Android emulator. Or run with your own device using the QR code and Expo.
